# ðŸ“¸ Photo Copier for Marketplace Channels

This Python project helps automate the process of copying product photos based on SKU codes listed in an Excel file.  
It is primarily designed to **prepare product image sets** to be uploaded or sent to **Marketplace platforms** such as:

- eMAG Marketplace

- Vivre
- Other B2C Retailers

If a photo for a SKU code is not found, the Excel cell is highlighted in red, allowing easy visual checking.
